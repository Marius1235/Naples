# Python Code Standard Sheet

## Naming Conventions
- Use `camelCase` for variable and function names
- Use `PascalCase` for class names
- Use `UPPERCASE` for constants

## Code Formatting
- Use 1 tab
- Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions

## Comments
- Use inline comments sparingly and only when necessary to explain non-obvious code
- Write a sentence or two before all functions that explain what they do.

## Imports
- Use absolute imports rather than relative imports

## Best Practices
- Write code that is compatible with Python 3.x whenever possible
